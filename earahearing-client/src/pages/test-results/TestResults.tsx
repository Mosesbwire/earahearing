                    More recently, research is demonstrating the need to urgently intervene when hearing loss is indicated. Research has shown a strong relationship between hearing loss that is not treated and cognitive decline. This means that if you do not treat your hearing loss with hearing aids, than it can lead to memory problems, problems with balance, focus, comprehension, attention, concentration and much more. In addition, newer research has recently published that hearing aids have been proven to slow the affects of cognitive decline immediately!
