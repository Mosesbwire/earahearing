        A severe hearing loss indicates you have difficulty in many different listening situations like one-on-one conversations, group settings, television or phone calls.  
        Patients with severe hearing loss will miss conversation at a normal volume, the telephone ringing at a normal volume or the doorbell should someone knock on the front door. 
        Severe hearing loss can happen for many different reasons. The most common reasons for severe hearing loss are: noise exposures and family history of hearing loss.
        Noise exposures are oftentimes the most common cause of hearing loss. Firearms, loud concerts and power tools can cause hearing loss after repeated usage for many years. These types of exposures can cause outer hair cell death, which results in the loss of hearing and therefore, the clarity of speech.
        Hearing loss is often ignored, sadly. Many patients will avoid addressing any issues as they do not want to wear a “hearing aid” or spend $4000!
