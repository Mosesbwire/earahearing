        Mild hearing loss indicates you will have difficulty hearing in different listening situations, mainly in noisy places like crowds of people. It is not uncommon to increase the television volume or put the telephone on speaker to hear it clearly with this type of hearing loss. Patients will often say, “I can hear people talking, but I just don’t understand what they’re saying sometimes- it’s not clear”. 
        For example: you may hear the word “cat” instead of the word “cap”. This happens because the clarity of speech is missing in a mild hearing loss. 
        Mild hearing loss can happen for many different reasons. The most common reasons for mild hearing loss are: noise exposures and family history of hearing loss.
        Noise exposures are oftentimes the most common cause of hearing loss. Firearms, loud concerts and power tools can cause hearing loss after repeated usage for many years. These types of exposures can cause outer hair cell death, which results in the loss of hearing and therefore, the clarity of speech.
        Hearing loss is often ignored, sadly. Many patients will avoid addressing any issues as they do not want to wear a “hearing aid” or spend $4000!
