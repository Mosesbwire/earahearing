        The test indicates you may have normal hearing. This is great news! 
        Make sure to always wear hearing protection when you’re in a lot of noise, otherwise, exposing your ears to loud sounds overtime can cause hearing loss.</p>

        <p className="text text-dark text-centered cap-text">
            If you’re surprised to see that the results are normal, there are explanations for how this can happen. 
            Hearing loss does not always appear on a hearing test, as the process of how we hear is very complex.

        <p className="text text-dark text-centered cap-text">
            Hearing loss can be present from cellular damage, the damage can be caused from exposure to loud sounds (i.e., machinery, firearm use, power tools, etc.) or from other factors such like genetic predisposition to hearing loss.
        </p>
        <p className="text text-dark text-centered cap-text">
        This type of hearing loss leads to difficulty understanding conversations in noise, even when the hearing test shows normal hearing. 
        </p>
        <p className="text text-dark text-centered cap-text">
        While a hearing test may show normal hearing, those who experience difficulty understanding speech in noisy situations may be experiencing a type of hearing loss known as "hidden" hearing loss. 
        This is because the hearing cells are damaged, which makes hearing more challenging.
